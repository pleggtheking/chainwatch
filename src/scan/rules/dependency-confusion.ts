/**
 * Rule 6: dependency_confusion
 *
 * Detects the classic dependency-confusion attack: a scoped package `@org/pkg`
 * is installed from the PUBLIC npm registry when the org intended it to come
 * from their PRIVATE registry. The attack works by publishing a higher-version
 * public package with the same scoped name.
 *
 * Detection:
 *  - Package has a scope (`@org/...`)
 *  - package-lock.json shows it resolved from registry.npmjs.org (public)
 *    when a private registry is configured in .npmrc for that scope
 *
 * Severity: CRITICAL
